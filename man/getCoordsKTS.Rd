}
\description{
This function allows to manually select points from a plot and get their coordinates. It is used through the button Get coordinates in the Plots menu.
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\details{
This function has two steps. In the first place, it is necessary to select a time series and plot it. The plot appears on a pop-up window. Then, the user clicks on one or more points and they turn green. When the user presses the Write results button, a list of coordinates (time and value) appears on the output window.
