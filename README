KarsTS 2.4

KarsTS is an R-based code with a GUI designed to analyze microclimatic time series with an emphasis on underground environments, such as caves; nonetheless, it can be useful in many other fields of research.

KarsTS was born as a package for time series gap filling and thus, it offers multiple univariate and multivariate gap filling tools. However, as KarsTS was intended to be a self-sufficient program, it soon grew to encompass several tools for linear and nonlinear time series analysis, preprocessing and plotting. In particular, KarsTS includes several tools for recurrence analysis.
